  SHORTCOMINGS/CONCERNS
  - Still trying to understand the dynamics of UML
  - One underscore = private attribute, yes?
  - Two underscores = protected, correct?
  - Should one underscore should be a minus sign (-) and two underscores should be a pound (#)?
  - Why does the__init__ constructor have a "+" next to it on the example UML diagrams?
  - David started the unit test but did not get far
  - Chijioke got some guidance on the code structure from Yvonne
